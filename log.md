# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Monday, January 1

**Today's Progress**: I've begun work on the new [TheCraftKid Project Showcase](https://thecraftkid.github.io),
and I've begun to finish up Countdowns 2.0.0, a big update to a project I
started months ago.

**Thoughts**: While I'm technically on an 11 day streak, I've decided to begin
the challenge today since, well, it's New Year's Day. I find it quite symbolic 
that I'm starting the challenge by beginning yet another project; however, this
is a project with a scope that is very well defined: documentation for all my
projects.

### Day 2: Tuesday, January 2

**Today's Progress**: Due to my recent interest in LastPass's great password
management service, I've built an Android app that creates hashes of inputted
strings. Sure, definitely not for generating passwords, but I wanted to bulid
something in an hour.

**Thoughts**: I need to work on building up a larger attention span. It
appears for all its strengths, the internet is a very distracting place.
